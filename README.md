Virtual Tourist

The Virtual Tourist is result of iOS Persistence and Core Data lesson of Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree course.

The app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist boththe pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin coordinates. Users will also be able to move pins to download new pictures and remove pins if they need them anymore.

MapController CollectionController

Implementation

The app has two view controller scenes:

MapController - shows the map and allows user to drop pins around the world. Users can drag pin to a new location after dropping them. As soon as a pin is dropped photo data for the pin location is fetched from Flickr. The actual photo downloads occur in the CollectionController.

CollectionController - allow users to download photos and edit an album for a location. Users can create new collections and delete photos from existing albums.

Application uses CoreData to store Pins (NSManagedObjectContext.executeFetchRequest) and Photos (NSFetchedResultsController) objects. All API calls run in background (NSURLSession.dataTaskWithRequest). Preloaded files saved in memory cache (NSCache) and file system (NSFileManager) and removed as soon as Photo object removed from CoreData.
